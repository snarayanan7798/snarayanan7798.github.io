There has also been a decrease in how much of an article that people read.</p><p><span class="color--dark-italic">Most people will just scroll through their newsfeed and stumble upon relevant news content but just read the headlines.</span></p><p>There are also many "fake news" that compete for attention with sensational headlines which tends to get shared more often due to the lack of readers fact checking or reading more than the headline.</p><div class="card"> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicolemartin1/2018/11/30/how-social-media-has-changed-how-we-consume-news/#7bf2c803c3ca" class="link" target="_blank"> <p class="link-title">How Social Media Has Changed How We Consume News</p><p class="link-desc">It’s the age of “fake news” and gone are the days of waiting for the morning news for breaking stories.</p><p class="link-desc">www.forbes.com</p></a> </div><p><span class="color--dark-italic">Time Period: 2 Days</span></p><p class="headline"><span class="big-text">Ideation</span></p><p class="sub-head">Ideating the product</p><p>Interested by this problem, I wanted to design a platform (mobile application) to help fact check the news content which seems false. The way I thought to solve this issue is to design a score based news checking app where users can mark an article right or wrong.</p><p>If the news gets more positive response, it will be counted as true and if it receives more negative response, it'll be counted as false. Simple.</p><P>I also thought of gamifying this concept because it can immensely help in increasing the user participation in fact checking the news and help the community from false news.</P> <p class="headline"><span class="big-text">High-Fi Wireframes</span></p><p><span class="Med--text">Onboarding</span></p><img src="images/newscheck-one.png" class="size-down" data-action="zoom"> <p>I focused on the onboarding experience because in my research I found that it's important to let user know what they can do with the app.</p><p>I also opted for Facebook sign in option because it makes it easier for everyone to quickly sign in and use the app. It saves the hassle of entering all the details like name, password etc.</p><p><span class="Med--text">Homepage - Find</span></p><img src="images/newscheck-two.png" class="size-down" data-action="zoom"> <p>After signing in, the homescreen shows two option at the top - Find and Play.</p><p>Find is where the user can paste the news article link to find out if that news is correct or wrong. The outcome is based on, if the news recieived more positve or negative response. If that news is not present in the database, there is this option of "Add" which can be used to add this news.</p><p><span class="Med--text">Game</span></p><img src="images/newscheck-three.png" class="size-down" data-action="zoom"> <p>Play is where you user can fact check an article and mark it right or wrong. If the news gets more positive response, it will be counted as true and if it receives more negative response, it'll be counted as false.</p><p>User's ranking will improve everytime they answer a question correctly and their ranking falls everytime they answer a question wrong.</p><p>I thought this gamification part is essential to maintain and increase user engagement which helps the community from false news.</p><p class="headline"><span class="big-text">Bottom Notes</span></p><p class="sub-head">What I learned?</p><p>This simple design project taught me to focus on the end goal by focusing on the things like increasing user engagement through gamification and clearly communicatin via the onboarding screen because letting user know what they can use this app for before they start using it, is important.</p><p>Thanks for reading!
