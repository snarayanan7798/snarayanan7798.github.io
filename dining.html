For this project I highly focused on finding insights about the user and their pain points to design the best solution accordingly. <br><br>Time Period: 3 Days</p><p class="headline"><span class="big-text">Research</span></p><p class="sub-head">Exploring user behaviour</p><p>Starting up this design project, I made some basic assumptions which came in my mind about the user —</p><ul class="list"> <li> <p><span class="color--dark">1. Goes out for lunch or dinner twice a week.</span></p></li><li> <p><span class="color--dark">2. Is generally with the team members or partner.</span></p></li><li> <p><span class="color--dark">3. Enjoys trying out new restaurants and different cuisines.</span></p></li><li> <p><span class="color--dark">4. Mostly goes at the prime time of the day.</span></p></li><li> <p><span class="color--dark">5. Chooses to drive/uber/ola to reach the restaurant.</span></p></li><li> <p><span class="color--dark">6. Checks out reviews, photos and the menu before choosing the restaurant.</span></p></li></ul> <p class="headline"><span class="big-text">Pain Points</span></p><p><span class="color--dark">1. Travel time </span> -  it often takes about 1 hour to travel to a restaurant due to traffic, and this is often a discouragement for groups to go out.</p><p><span class="color--dark">2. Waiting time </span> -  on some occasions and weekends restaurants usually have long queues and waiting time > 20 mins due to lot of customers.</p><p>Keeping these assumptions in my mind, I grabbed my notebook and started sketching some user flows and rough wireframes.</p><img src="images/sketch1.jpg" class="size-down" data-action="zoom"> <p>After this small sketching exercise, I felt I need some more substantial data to validate my assumptions about user needs and pain points  -  which will help me gain some more deeper insights. Following a more empathetic approach, I created a Google form and shared it to my friends who eat and try diverse cuisines every week at restaurants.</p><p><span class="color--dark">More than 30 people filled it, and this gave me some additional clarity.</span></p><p>Some key insights from the survey  -</p><p>1. Most important factor in choosing the restaurant is the rating over photos, price, cuisine etc. While other information also does matter, but having a higher rating is what people prefer in choosing the restaurant. If the ratings are low and reviews are average. Most likely my friends will not choose going to that restaurant.</p><p>2. Location of the restaurant also got a lot of response in the survey. Like sometimes someone might be at a new place, e.g - meeting a client. Since they won't be familiar with the surroundings and also don't want to travel longer distances to eat. Being able to see all the near-by restaurants according to their cuisine preference is a big help for them.</p><p><span class="color--dark-italic"><i>"Location has to be convenient to where I am currently at."</i></span></p><p>3. Customers also care a lot about where the table is located at the restaurant. Some of the bad locations I got in my mind are  -  near the door, down the air conditioner, next to the bathroom or kitchen.</p><p>4. When choosing a new restaurant many times customers are unsure about what to eat there and order something which doesn't tastes that good. If users can see what are the most ordered foods in the restaurant, it will surely help them to make a better decision in ordering the food.</p><img src="images/pain-points.png" class="size-down" data-action="zoom"> <p class="headline"><span class="big-text">User Persona</span></p><p>Validating the assumptions helped me come up with two main types of user groups which could benefit from such an app.</p><p>1. <span class="color--dark">Aarush</span> is 28 years old. Works at a startup. Takes his team members for lunch every week. They try out different near by restaurants and cuisines every other time when they visit.</p><img src="images/user-persona-one.png" class="size-down" data-action="zoom"> <p>2. <span class="color--dark">Archit</span> is 21 years old college graduate. Currently working at a tech company. He always initiates plans to go out for dinner or drinks, and makes reservations for everyone. He likes to try diverse cuisines. </p><img src="images/user-persona-two.png" class="size-down" data-action="zoom"> <p>A basic storyboard, I sketched to relate the user persona.</p><img src="images/userstory.jpg" class="sketch" data-action="zoom"> <p>After this I opened up Figma and started to create low-fidelity wireframes by putting all the new information I got from my survey.</p><p class="headline"><span class="big-text">Low Fidelity Mockups</span></p><p>With the help of user research and personas, I got the idea of what to design and then I started to create low fidelity wireframes.</p><img src="images/dining-wireframe-1.png" class="size-down" data-action="zoom"> <p class="img-text">I created two design's for the homescreen and ratings having the most priority in using the restaurant, I went with the second option.</p><img src="images/dining-wireframe-2.png" class="size-down" data-action="zoom"> <p class="img-text">Left: Filter Screen, Right: Restaurant Page. <br>Based on my user insights, I added all the features which helps the user.</p><img src="images/dining-wireframe-3.png" class="size-down" data-action="zoom"> <p class="img-text">Left: Booking a table, Right: Confirmation Page. <br>Request box which users can use to request their concerns.</p><p class="headline"><span class="big-text">High Fidelity Design</span></p><p class="sub-head">Finalizing the design</p><p>As most food apps use red as their primary color, I also chose red as the primary color. But generally red is associated with error so I didn't chose dark red. Then I created the high fidelity design.</p><p class="headline">1. Discovering Restaurants</p><img src="images/dining-final-1.png" class="size-down" data-action="zoom"> <p>The homescreen shows all the restaurants based on your filter selected. I prioritised data from the research in making all the design decisions. Each restaurant card shows the most important info  -  Cuisine, Cost and Distance.</p><p class="headline">2. Restaurant Page</p><img src="images/dining-final-2.png" class="size-down" data-action="zoom"> <p>My survey insights showed that people have a concern on what they should order when visiting a new restaurant. To solve that - the app shows you the most ordered foods with price. This helps the user to make better decision in choosing from the menu.</p><p class="headline">3. Booking a Table</p><img src="images/dining-final-3.png" class="size-down" data-action="zoom"> <p>Other concerns people had were about the location of the table, hygiene etc. A special request box solves that - where users can request few personalized changes to their dining experience.</p><p class="headline"><span class="big-text">Prototype</span></p><video width="684" height="594" autoplay loop muted> <source src="images/proto.mp4" type="video/mp4"/> </video> <p class="headline"><span class="big-text">Lessons Learned</span></p><p class="sub-head">What I learned?</p><p>1. Making design decisions through user research data ― Researching and collecting insights about the user needs helps in designing better products.</p><p>2. Following a design process is necessary. Effective researching before designing digitally helps a lot.</p><p><span class="color--dark-italic"><i>Researching → Creating personas → Building user flows → Wireframing → Prototyping</i></span></p><p>3. Moving on to designing high fidelity wireframes seems tempting but most of the work happens before that part.</p><p>Thanks for reading!
